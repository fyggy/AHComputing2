    <div class="form">
    <p class="explain">
        <span class="tab"></span>In short: this site is a method of visualising functions on complex numbers. It takes
        gridlines and displays the transformation after the application of the inputted function. If this means nothing
        to you, then read on.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Complex numbers</h2>
    <p class="explain">
        <span class="tab"></span>The complex numbers is an extension of the real numbers. The real numbers are numbers
        that we deal with every day, numbers like <span class="render">3, -2.45, \frac{2}{3}</span>or even
        <span class="render"> \pi</span>. However, they cannot do everything. In your life, you have probably squared a
        lot of numbers, and will have noticed that, if you square a number, it is always positive. The reason for this
        is quite simple: a positive number times a positive number is positive, and a negative number times a negative
        number is also a positive number. So now ask yourself: what is<span class="render">\sqrt{-1}</span>? Remember
        that the square root sign means "what number squared gives negative one". However, we just established that
        this is impossible, as any square number is positive. So that's just it then? Do we just say it doesn't exist?
        Well, mathematicians think not. What if we just made up a number that fits that description? All the other
        numbers are made up anyways, whats one more?. Lets call this new "imaginary" number
        <span class="render">i</span>, and so, the field of complex analysis was born.
    </p><br>
    <p class="explain">
        <span class="tab"></span>We can add complex numbers and real numbers together, like anything else, but we can't
        simplify it like usual. For example, <span class="render">2+i</span> is just <span class="render">2+i</span>.
        We can also multiply <span class="render">i</span> by a real number, such as <span class="render">3i</span>.
        Thus, a complex number can be any number of the form <span class="render">a+bi</span> where
        <span class="render">a</span> and <span class="render">b</span> are both real numbers. Adding and multiplying
        complex numbers is exactly the same to how you perform operations with real numbers. Simply treat
        <span class="render">i</span> like a variable instead of a number. For example:
    </p>
    <p class="equation">
        <span class="render">(3-4i) + (7+12i) = (3+7) + (-4+12)i</span> <br>
        <span class="render" style="position: relative; left: 23px;">= 10+8i</span><br><br>
        <span class="render">(3-4i) \cdot (7+12i) = 3\cdot7-4i\cdot7+3\cdot12i-4i\cdot12i</span> <br>
        <span class="render" style="position: relative; left: 30.5px;">= 21-28i+36i-48{i}^{2}</span> <br>
        <span class="render" style="position: relative; left: -1px;">= 21+8i+48</span> <br>
        <span class="render" style="position: relative; right: 19px;">= 69+8i</span> <br>
    </p>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Visualisations</h2>


    <p class="explain">
        <span class="tab"></span>Complex numbers can be thought of as coordinates on a 2-d plane. Take, for example,
        the number <span class="render">4+3i</span>. It can be visualised as the point 4 along and 3 up, like so.<br>
        <img src="media/threefour.png" width=451" height="339" alt="A grid with a point four along and three up"><br>
        <span class="tab"></span>Every point on a 2-d plane can be expressed this way, meaning that actually, in
        reality, the 2-d plane is actually just a bunch of complex numbers in disguise.
    </p> <br>
    <p class="explain">
        <span class="tab"></span>Now, you might be wondering how we visualise a function of these
        numbers. But first, what is a function? Well, in simple terms, a function takes a number as input, and gives a
        number as an output. in some senses, it "transforms" this number into a different number. Working with real
        numbers, we can visualise this quite easily. All you need is 2 dimensions to properly visualise a function: one
        for the input, and one for the output. This is the traditional method to visualise functions. However, with
        complex numbers, this is not possible. We already needed 2 dimensions to display a single complex number, how
        are we going to visualise the connection between 2 of them? The only way to do this seems to be to use 4
        dimensions, which the average human cannot comprehend properly.
    </p> <br>
    <p class="explain">
        <span class="tab"></span>This is the motivation behind this program. Here, we cheat by not explicitly showing
        the input point. Instead, we convey the information by calling the function on every point on the plane, and
        then display the shape that it makes afterwards. To show the shape of the plane, we show the way that the
        gridlines change. To preserve some of the input information, the lines move from the initial state before
        transformation, to the final state after transformation.
    </p> <br>
    <p class="explain">
        <span class="tab"></span>As an example, take the function<span class="render">f(x)=x^2</span>. On the real
        number line, this method is not very interesting, looking like this:
        <img src="media/realTransformation.png" alt="The transformation of a number line to its transformed equivalent.
        Top looks like a normal number line, bottom looks like a number line but the marks consistently get further
        away from each other." style="width: 800px; height: auto; margin: 0;"><br>
        <span class="tab"></span>However, using complex numbers, the transformation now looks like this:
        <img src="media/complexTransformation.gif" alt="The transformation of gridlines to its transformed equivalent.
        Left looks like many lines, Right looks like many parabolas intersecting"><br>
        <span class="tab"></span>This program allows you to visualise the transformation under any function, from any
        set of input gridlines. This is not the only way to visualise complex functions, but it allows for noticing
        similarities between 2 functions, and is quite intuitive.
    </p> <br><br>
    <h2 class="subtitle">How to use this site</h2>
    <div class="explain">
        <span class="tab"></span>First, enter a function into the input box. This is the function which will define the
        transformation. Then, enter your input space, as due to the limitations of computers, we are not able to transform
        the entire plane, only a section of it. The input space is entered as a rectangle. This line:
        <br> <br>
        <input class="numBox" type="number" name="lowerx" id="lowerx" step="0.001" size=12>
        <div class="numBox"><span class="render"><\Re(x)<</span></div>
        <input class="numBox clearfix" type="number" name="upperx" id="upperx" step="0.001" size=12>
        <br> <br>
        represents where the left and right sides of this rectangle fall, and this line:
        <br> <br>
        <input class="numBox" type="number" name="lowery" step="0.001" size=12>
        <div class="numBox"><span class="render"><\Im(x)<</span></div>
        <input class="numBox" style="position: relative; left: 4.66px" type="number" name="uppery" step="0.001" size=12>
        <br> <br>
        represents where the top and bottom sides of this rectangle fall. For example,
        <span class="render">-5<\Re(x)<10,\ \ 1<\Im(x)<3</span> would represent the rectangle
        <img src="media/shape.png" style="width:800px; height: auto;" alt="A long and thin rectangle with vertices
        (-5, 1), (-5. 3), (10, 3), (10, 1)"> <br>
        <span class="tab"></span>Lines are then placed within this rectangle, spaced by an amount, called line step or
        line spacing. For example, for a spacing of 0.5, the above rectangle would have lines placed like so
        <img src="media/lines.png" style="width: 800px; height: auto;" alt="A rectangle with red and blue evenly spaced
        lines. There are 5 blue lines running from left to right, and 31 red lines running from top to bottom"><br>
        <span class="tab"></span>These lines are then transformed by the inputted function. The parameter "precision" is
        then used to determine how precise the function is to be evaluated as: minimum means 50 points, low means 100
        points, medium means 500 points, high means 1000 points, and maximum means 5000 points. If a function seems
        broken; either it has parts that are missing, or lines that dont seem like they are in the right place, then
        increasing the precision likely will make those artefacts disappear.
    </div>
    <p class="explain">
        <span class="tab"></span>Finally, you'll enter how you want to view the transformation. First, enter where you
        want to center your view. Simply enter a complex number, and the center of the screen will be that number.
        The width, however, is slightly more complicated. The width represents the distance between the center point of
        the screen and the edge of the screen. For example, for a view centered at <span class="render">0+0i</span>,
        and with a radius of 10, then the point at the center of the left edge of the screen will be -10+0i and the
        poit and the point at the center of the right edge of the screen will be 10+0i. The points at the top and
        bottom, however, are determined by your screen width and height. Intuitively, the width is how zoomed in the
        output is.
